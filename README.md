# Advent of Code

These are my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.

I've used different programming languages to implement the solutions over the years as a learning exercise.

For 2020, the entries were written in Python, with a sprinkling of C and assembly.

For 2021 and 2022, the entries were written in Rust.

For 2023, the entries were written in C++.

For 2025, Kotlin was used.
